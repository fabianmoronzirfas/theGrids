These two InDesign Javascripts are for the typo seminar at the FHP

the script theImageGrid.jsx builds a page and loads images from a folder that the user specifies. Within this Repo there are two folders with nine images each. Use these. This script is optimzed for nine images.

the script theTypoGrid.jsx makes an quad with about 400 o's and changes the fillTint of each character to a given value.
the Script theValues.jsx contains the values for the script theTypoGrid.jsx

in the branch processing is the processing sketch imageToFile.pde
this makes a textfile with the brightness values from an givin greyscale image with 20 x 20 pixels. This is the basis for theValues.jsx
